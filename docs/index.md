# [something about getting distracted?]

Hello, I'm a silly person on the Internet, of dragons and bananas.

I'm on various platforms, such as:

- Discord, as `a__distraction`
    -  [The "Nargacrewga" Discord](https://discord.gg/duzVYHy)
- Matrix, as `@a_distraction:matrix.org` (though not using it much)
- Steam, usually as ["a distraction"](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dresklaw/)
- Stoat, as `a_distraction#4964`
- Telegram as [`@Dresklaw`](https://t.me/Dresklaw)
- VRChat, as [`a distraction`](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_480d8ac9-5542-44d2-9706-d248beac0510)

I've done a number of silly things, such as:

- [forking](https://github.com/dresklaw/ValheimPlayerModels) to maintain [ValheimPlayerModels](https://github.com/Ikeiwa/ValheimPlayerModels), and getting such onto [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ValheimPlayerModels/ValheimPlayerModels/)
- maintaining the ["TongueyToastacuga"], which started with some minor modifications of [Toastador's](https://twitter.com/NeoToasteo) [posted](https://twitter.com/NeoToasteo/status/1237377668594593792)
[Toastacuga](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k9P3Fy3rFoBkzYcqevjvIybxYyXl65Z6/view), but has grown somewhat over time
    - just to highlight, but in that ["TongueyToastacuga" Google Drive]["TongueyToastacuga"], the ["Misc" directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kjYNJKsrNAHIwF2glhKRxtZkip3FBgdo) contains various related assets, such as Substance Painter files and the Blender file from which the Unitypackages were derived
- miscellaneous other odds and ends of things that either aren't coming to mind, or I don't care to mention. :P
